## Add variables in code

To start with variables you will need to setup variable controls within your template code, like the following:

```tsx
setupVariableControls(Untitled, {
  inviterName: {
    label: "Title",
    type: "companyName",
    placeholder: "This is title",
    description: "Person who send the invitation",
  },
});
```

To learn more about `setupVariableControls` you can learn the [dedicated API documentation](/dedale/api/setup-variable-controls)
