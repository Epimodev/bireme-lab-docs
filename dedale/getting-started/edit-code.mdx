## Edit code

Everything to do with model development is based on [React](https://react.dev), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and the [React Email](react.email) library, which provides a collection of unstyled components.

We invite you to browse [the React Email documentation](https://react.email/docs) to learn more about developing an email template with React and TypeScript.
