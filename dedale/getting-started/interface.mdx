## Understanding the Dédale interface

Dédale has been designed to make important functions available in an intuitive way.
We have designed navigation in the form of panels, accessible via the toolbar on the right of the interface.

In order from top to bottom you'll find the following panels:
- **Variables**: for modifying variable values (which we'll talk about later)
- **Code**
- **Information**
