<Accordion title ="What's Dédale for?">

Dédale is a **free service** dedicated to companies and independants looking to create, develop and organize their mail templates with ease.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title ="Why did you create Dédale?">

We created Dédale in response to a problem we encountered during the development of Bireme Lab: how to optimize our workflow for creating, managing and sending e-mails for sales, marketing and transactional purposes.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title ="Who is Dédale for, and what are its uses?">

In its first version, Dédale is aimed at developers who want to improve their email template development experience. Our short-term goal is to make the product accessible without any technical prerequisites.

<Accordion title ="How does Dédale differ from React Email?">

Dédale relies on React Email for the development of email templates. Our aim is to improve the development experience around React e-mail, such as with a better preview system or the ability to integrate variables. Full details of Dédale's features are available [on this page](/dedale/concept).

<Accordion title ="How do I create an email template with Dédale?">

We've created a documention to help you [get started quickly with Dédale](/dedale/quick-start), with the aim of guiding you all the way to importing into your favorite mailing service.

<Accordion title ="Can I integrate Dédale with my email service?">

With Dédale you can export your email template in `HTML` format, highly compatible with most existing professional tools. We've written guides to help you import a template into services like [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/) or [HubSpot](https://www.hubspot.fr/).
