Emailing is a powerful tool for mass communication, enabling you to reach a large audience in an effective and personalized way. Here's how Daedalus can help you optimize your email campaigns.

## What is emailing?

Emailing, or mass e-mailing, is used to transmit messages to a large list of recipients. This includes, for example:

- **Newsletters:** Regular e-mails sent to a mailing list to inform subscribers of the latest news, updates or blog posts,
- **Marketing campaigns:** promotional e-mails sent to announce sales, new products or events,
- **Internal communication:** e-mails to inform employees about company updates or internal events.
