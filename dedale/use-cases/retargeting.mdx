Retargeting is an essential strategy for optimizing conversion and re-engaging users. Here's how Dédale can help you maximize the effectiveness of your retargeting campaigns.

## What is retargeting?

Retargeting consists of sending personalized e-mails to users based on their previous behavior or actions, with the aim of encouraging them to complete a desired action. Examples include:

- Close to the end of the contract:** Offer discounts or special offers close to the end of the contract to encourage renewal,
- Repeat visits:** Encourage users who frequently visit a page to take action,
- Browsing without purchase:** Propose personalized offers or recommendations to users who have browsed the site without making a purchase.

## Examples of how to use Dédale for retargeting

- Create an e-mail template reminding users of the items they've left in their shopping cart. Add product images, descriptions and calls to action to encourage purchase,
- **Personalized recommendation e-mail:** Send e-mails containing product recommendations based on items users have previously viewed or purchased,
- **re-engagement e-mails:** Design e-mail templates to re-engage users who haven't visited your site in a while. Propose special offers or new products to entice them to return.
