Retargeting is an essential strategy for optimizing conversion and re-engaging users. Here's how Dédale can help you maximize the effectiveness of your retargeting campaigns.

## What is retargeting?

Retargeting consists of sending personalized emails to users based on their previous behavior or actions, with the aim of encouraging them to complete a desired action. Examples include:

- **Close to the end of the contract:** Offer discounts or special offers close to the end of the contract to encourage renewal,
- **Repeat visits:** Encourage users who frequently visit a page to take action,
- **Browsing without purchase:** Propose personalized offers or recommendations to users who have browsed the site without making a purchase.

## Examples of how to use Dédale for retargeting

- Create an email template reminding users the list of items they've left in their shopping cart. Add product images, descriptions and calls to action to encourage purchase,

- **re-engagement emails:** Design email templates to re-engage users who haven't visited your site in a while. Propose special offers or new products to entice them to return.
