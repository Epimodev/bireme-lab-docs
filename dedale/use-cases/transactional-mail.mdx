Transactional emails are essential for one-to-one communication with your users, often in response to their specific actions. Here's how Dédale can help you optimize your transactional e-mails.

## What is a transactional email?

A transactional email is a message sent automatically to a user following a specific action. For example :

- **Order confirmation:** e-mails sent after a purchase to confirm the order and provide details,
- **Password reset:** e-mails sent to allow users to reset their password,
- **Account Alerts:** Notifications of important user account activity, such as logins or profile changes,
